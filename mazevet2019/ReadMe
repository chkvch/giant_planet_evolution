Abstract:
    The modeling of planetary interiors requires accurate equations of
    state for the basic constituents with proven validity in the difficult
    pressure-temperature regime extending up to 50000K and hundreds of
    Mbars. While equations of state based on first principles simulations
    are now available for the two most abundant elements, hydrogen and
    helium, the situation is less satisfactory for water where no
    wide-range equation of state is available despite its need for
    interior modeling of planets ranging from super-Earths to planets
    several times the size of Jupiter.

    As a first step toward a multi-phase equation of state for dense
    water, we develop a temperature-dependent equation of state for dense
    water covering the liquid and plasma regimes and extending to the
    super-ionic and gas regimes. This equation of state covers the
    complete range of conditions encountered in planetary modeling.

    We use first principles quantum molecular dynamics simulations and its
    Thomas-Fermi extension to reach the highest pressures encountered in
    giant planets several times the size of Jupiter. Using these results,
    as well as the data available at lower pressures, we obtain a
    parametrization of the Helmholtz free energy adjusted over this
    extended temperature and pressure domain. The parametrization ignores
    the entropy and density jumps at phase boundaries but we show that it
    is sufficiently accurate to model interior properties of most planets
    and exoplanets.

    We produce an equation of state given in analytical form that is
    readily usable in planetary modeling codes and dynamical simulations
    (a fortran implementation can be found at
    http://www.ioffe.ru/astro/H2O/). The EOS produced is valid for the
    entire density range relevant to planetary modeling, for densities
    where quantum effects for the ions can be neglected, and for
    temperatures below 50000K. We use this equation of state to calculate
    the mass-radius relationship of exoplanets up to 5000M_{Earth}_,
    explore temperature effects in ocean and wet Earth-like planets, and
    quantify the influence of the water EOS for the core on the
    gravitational moments of Jupiter.

Description:
    The FORTRAN code implement the fitting formula for the EOS of dense
    water in the interiors of planets and exoplanets. Detailed
    descriptions of all subroutines are given by comment lines in the
    files. For the domain of applicability of the underlying data and
    fitting formulae, see the text and Fig.5 of the paper

   H2OFIT : Given the mass density RHO(g/cm^3^) and temperature T(K),
             returns the fits to the thermodynamic functions:
             PnkT - pressure, normalized to (kT times number density)
             FNkT - Helmholtz free energy per atom, normalized by kT
             UNkT - internal energy per atom, normalized by kT
             CV - specific heat per atom in units of Boltzmann constant k
             CHIT - logarithmic derivative of pressure over temperature
             CHIR - logarithmic derivative of pressure over density
             PMbar - pressure in Mbar
             USPEC - specific internal energy in ergs/gram
   ELECNR : For a given electron number density and temperature (in atomic
            units), returns normalized thermodynamic functions in the model
            of an ideal nonrelativistic Fermi gas: chemical potential
            divided by kT; Helmholtz free energy and internal energy per
            electron, divided by kT; specific heat per atom in units of k;
            logarithmic derivatives of electron pressure over temperature
            and density

  FERINT  : fits (according to Antia 1993ApJS...84..101A) to nonrelativistic
             Fermi integrals of the order of -1/2, 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2

  FINVER  : fits (according to Antia 1993ApJS...84..101A) to the inverse Fermi
             integrals of the order of -1/2, 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2
