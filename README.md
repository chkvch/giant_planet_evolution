The code is adapted from Daniel P. Thorngren's evolutionary program evolve.py [2016ApJ...831...64T].

### Getting started
Simply run the main program in `ongp.py` to test a static Jupiter model:
```
cd v2
python ongp.py
```
Check out `ongp.py.__main__` to see what it's doing and adapt that pattern for your needs.
