#An environment for making one-dimensional static and evolutionary models of giant planets. 
The code is adapted from Daniel P. Thorngren's evolutionary program evolve.py, but extended to include a more general equation of state for H-He-Z mixtures, a H-He phase diagram for the purposes of modelling H-He phase separation, and model atmospheres specific to Jupiter and Saturn.
