the issue is that the zone k1 generally gets to decide what the envelope abundance is, even if
zones further out are also raining out. the code that sets homogeneous molecular envelope abundance 
needs to be fixed to allow two user-facing options:

in either case all zones with y>ymax get y set to ymax, which generally might have an inversion. then either
1) y inversions are kept, so that the outermost such zone determines envelope y;
2) y inversions are assumed convectively unstable so that the minimum y determines envelope y.
	(really for this option the envelope should be set to the mean y of the material to be mixed.)
